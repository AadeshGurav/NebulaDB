## 📦 Architecture (Work in Progress)

- `core/` – Shared types, serialization, config
- `storage/` – Block engine, I/O layout, compression
- `index/` – ID + (soon) secondary indexing
- `wal/` – Write-ahead log system
- `query/` – Execution engine + parser (planned)
- `cli/` – REPL + JSON query interface
- `apps/server/` – Optional HTTP server / gRPC API
